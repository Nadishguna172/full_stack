To install the OpenSSH server on Ubuntu, you can use the following command:

sudo apt install openssh-server

Explanation

    sudo: Runs the command with administrative privileges.
    apt install: Tells the package manager to install the specified package.
    openssh-server: This is the package name for the OpenSSH server, which allows you to access your machine remotely via SSH.

Verify Installation

After installing, you can check if the SSH service is running with:

sudo systemctl status ssh

If it’s not running, start it with:

sudo systemctl start ssh

To enable SSH on system boot, use:

sudo systemctl enable ssh

Testing SSH

You can test the SSH server by connecting to it locally:

ssh localhost

If you see a prompt asking for your username and password, then the SSH server is set up correctly!

If you're looking to install the OpenSSH client (which allows you to connect to other machines via SSH), you can use the following command:

sudo apt install openssh-client

Explanation

    The openssh-client package provides the SSH client, allowing you to connect to remote SSH servers.

Verify Installation

Once installed, you can verify it by checking the SSH version:

ssh -V

If installed correctly, this command will display the SSH version number.
Using the SSH Client

To connect to a remote server using SSH, you can use:

ssh username@remote_server_ip

Replace username with your remote user’s name and remote_server_ip with the IP address or hostname of the server you want to connect to.
